## Justification of Research Work

### Introduction
The construction sector in Nigeria faces significant challenges due to the alarming rate of building collapses, with 271 recorded instances in the past ten years alone. This has resulted in 531 fatalities, highlighting the urgent need for advanced technologies to monitor structural integrity and predict failures. Emerging technologies like Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the Internet of Things (IoT) present viable solutions for enhancing Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) practices.

### Aim and Objectives
The primary aim of this research is to determine the deflection of a simply supported beam subjected to a moving load using Python. The specific objectives include:
- Deriving and implementing the Euler-Bernoulli beam theory.
- Implementing the Euler-Bernoulli beam equation using the Rayleigh-Ritz approximation method for deflection calculations.
- Obtaining the natural frequency of various beam types (simply supported, clamped-clamped, and clamped-free).
- Analyzing tapered beams under clamped conditions.

### Addressing the Research Gap
Most structural engineering research is currently implemented using MATLAB, which, while effective, does not leverage the advancements in AI. Pythonâ€™s recent developments have made it a powerful alternative for implementing structural analysis methods, addressing the existing research gap.

### Significance of the Study
Predicting and detecting structural failures can significantly reduce economic costs and fatalities associated with structural failures. By utilizing AI and IoT technologies, this research aims to identify damage within structures, thus improving the reliability of predictive maintenance strategies.
